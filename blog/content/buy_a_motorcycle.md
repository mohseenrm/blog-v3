So you've made it, had enough with being normal and decided it wasn't for you. Maybe you've had a hard time and made poor choices in life, that got you to a divorce or made you vegan or both. Whatever it may be, welcome! and prepare to roam the earth as Mad Max slaying commute zombies and getting to work/school/dentist like a badass you are.

Before you swing your foot over the two wheeled crotch rocket there are a few things you should look out for that will make your badassery effortless.

Whether it's the end of the world or you need to convince yourself this is a great idea, you need lists. Here's a list of stuff you'll need to read up about:

* Type of motorcycle
* **Insurance** (a.k.a backup)
* Motorcycle safety course
* Gear & After market parts
* License*

(*fun tip: While you might need a license to ride a motorcycle, you do not need one to buy it. But get it though)

### Type of motorcycle

There are plenty of types of motorcycles out there and you need to pick the best one for you. Each type has it's strengths and weakness and you cannot (should not) take you shining new white sportsbike offroad in a damp terrain.

I'll leave the in depth analysis of each type of motorcycle to desk folk (*cough* qualified people *cough*).

#### Sport

Most nimble and agile of all the bikes, they can tear canyon roads with ease (*driven by an skilled rider) or shave 0.85 secs on the best lap time (*also not you). That being said they are really fun to ride with a bit of an aggressive riding style and glee happy leaning over either side. Even within this category there are different types based on capacity of the engine (cc) and it's types (V2s, Inline 4s..).

> My advice, make a wise choice and try to stick with it

#### Cruisers

Bigger, broader and cooler looking of it brethren. This is perfect for going out on your quests for searching life's meaning or not dealing with your mid life crisis. Just kidding, if you're serious about hauling groceries, cruisers are for you. With saddles and comfier seats, these are great for short and long distance rides.
Harleys and Indians (not the people) make great looking bikes that are low and comfortable to ride on. Some of them (mostly touring versions) also come with extravagances like heated grips we mere mortals can only dream of.

#### Naked

The unholy bastard love child of sport and cruiser bikes. They usually have a tuned sports engine with stripped down fairings to reduce excess weight with a more upright seating position. These bikes are drop dead gorgeous with ample power for urban chariotting (*not an actual word, but should be).

#### Touring

These bikes are great for long distance traveller. If you ever wanted to ride across different countries and make friends along the way this type of motorcycle would be ideal. They generally have good low end torque and great weather protection, bigger fuel tanks and saddles. Before you head out, do get a pair of earplugs (sold separately).

### Insurance

This is **KEY** for make a good purchase. Do lookup the insurance for **you** and the specific make and model you are thinking of purchasing. Insurance providers often have a questionnaire to fill that will give you an estimate on how much insurance will cost you. My first purchase I made was without a license and no driving history making my monthly payment like buying a new nintendo switch ever month (not that I wanted it, but would have been nice).

*Quick tip: in the states, if you are planning to purchase a high end sports bike, StateFarm offers insurance based on the pure cc's of an engine and not the brand. That's great for 1000cc+ Ducatistas because parts and repair for them are costly.*

### Motorcycle Safety Course


---------

Riding is exciting and even better is a mean machine to tear down those twisties. But before you swing a foot on motorcycle here's some boring stuff you have to get together before riding into the wind.

This post is not to discourage you from buying a motorcycle. I highly advocate more people use it. Talk about a smooth cruise to work. A lot of other things like insurance, maintenance can chip at your joy of riding.

Here's a top list of things to figure out before you go out and purchase that sweet 2 wheeled crotch rocket.

* Type of motorcycle
* **Insurance**
* Motorcycle safety course
* Gear
* After market parts
* License

Alright on to the fun part!

### Type of motorcycle

Whether you're a newbie or you're thinking of buying your third motorcycle for the stable, you have some idea of what's excites you about riding. Unlike what Susan believes that all bikes are Harley's, there are dozens of categories for motorcycles (naked, sports, sports touring, cruisers...)

Regardless of the type of bike you choose. I highly recommend watching "Twist of the wrist" by YYY. It provides a great start of information that'll make you enjoy riding longer.

#### Sport

These dangerous devils run fast and are very nimble on the turns. I personally like riding sport bikes the most mainly because of the sense of control I feel when I lean in and open the throttle. They're great for a short trip or tearing down the canyons and generally very forgiving of rider errors.
That being said, it's also easy to get throttle happy and let loose more than you should at the time. These bikes generally have a more aggressive riding position that might take some time to getting used to. Don't be let down by that fact, it'll feel natural after a few rides.

> Be well aware of how much traction you have at any time or weather. Healthy appreciation of nature and friction will do you good.

I'll write up more on how not to ride a motorcycle to cover more tips that helped becoming a safer and happy rider.

#### Cruiser

These bikes look mean and badass, and will definitely let you enjoy long and short rides. Also one of the comfier options out there in terms of ergonomics.

#### Naked

Kind of like the love child of sport bikes and sports touring without the fairings. Each manufacturer has different ideas on what a naked bike is, but essentially its a motorcycle with a sports engine, stripped down fairings and excess weight removed with a more upright sitting position.

#### Touring


#### Dirt & Offroad

Much lighter with loaded up suspensions. These bikes are well equipped for a offroad dirt road. Also really easy to begin riding motorcycles and they can take a hell of a beating.

Quick note, if you like a high end bike, you might be restricted by the type of license you posses (Europe, Japan) in order to be able to ride. More information on this later on.

### Insurance

This is **HUGE**, take into account how much the insurance of the bike will be. My first motorcycle I purchase without a license (technically you don't need one to buy a motorcycle ;)) and insurance ridiculously high (early 20s with no driving history). In the states, there are tons of providers that will give you a quote online by filling a questionnaire.

If you're not buying the bike outright, you will have to add this along with your payment and it will add it. I get that you're pumped up about this bike, but have a quick look at what insurance will cost you.

Quick tip, in the states, StateFarm provides insurance based on the cc's of an engine and doesn't care about the type of bike. That's great for 1000cc+ Ducatistas because parts and repair for them are costly.
