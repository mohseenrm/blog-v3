Riding is exciting and even better is a mean machine to tear down those twisties. But before you swing a foot on motorcycle here's some boring stuff you have to get together before riding into the wind.

This post is not to discourage you from buying a motorcycle. I highly advocate more people use it. Talk about a smooth cruise to work. A lot of other things like insurance, maintenance can chip at your joy of riding.

Here's a top list of things to figure out before you go out and purchase that sweet 2 wheeled crotch rocket.

* Type of motorcycle
* **Insurance**
* Motorcycle safety course
* Gear
* After market parts
* License

Alright on to the fun part!

### Type of motorcycle

Whether you're a newbie or you're thinking of buying your third motorcycle for the stable, you have some idea of what's excites you about riding. Unlike what Susan believes that all bikes are Harley's, there are dozens of categories for motorcycles (naked, sports, sports touring, cruisers...)

Regardless of the type of bike you choose. I highly recommend watching "Twist of the wrist" by YYY. It provides a great start of information that'll make you enjoy riding longer.

#### Sport

These dangerous devils run fast and are very nimble on the turns. I personally like riding sport bikes the most mainly because of the sense of control I feel when I lean in and open the throttle. They're great for a short trip or tearing down the canyons and generally very forgiving of rider errors.
That being said, it's also easy to get throttle happy and let loose more than you should at the time. These bikes generally have a more aggressive riding position that might take some time to getting used to. Don't be let down by that fact, it'll feel natural after a few rides.

> Be well aware of how much traction you have at any time or weather. Healthy appreciation of nature and friction will do you good.

I'll write up more on how not to ride a motorcycle to cover more tips that helped becoming a safer and happy rider.

#### Cruiser

These bikes look mean and badass, and will definitely let you enjoy long and short rides. Also one of the comfier options out there in terms of ergonomics.

#### Naked

Kind of like the love child of sport bikes and sports touring without the fairings. Each manufacturer has different ideas on what a naked bike is, but essentially its a motorcycle with a sports engine, stripped down fairings and excess weight removed with a more upright sitting position.

#### Touring


#### Dirt & Offroad

Much lighter with loaded up suspensions. These bikes are well equipped for a offroad dirt road. Also really easy to begin riding motorcycles and they can take a hell of a beating.

Quick note, if you like a high end bike, you might be restricted by the type of license you posses (Europe, Japan) in order to be able to ride. More information on this later on.

### Insurance

This is **HUGE**, take into account how much the insurance of the bike will be. My first motorcycle I purchase without a license (technically you don't need one to buy a motorcycle ;)) and insurance ridiculously high (early 20s with no driving history). In the states, there are tons of providers that will give you a quote online by filling a questionnaire.

If you're not buying the bike outright, you will have to add this along with your payment and it will add it. I get that you're pumped up about this bike, but have a quick look at what insurance will cost you.

Quick tip, in the states, StateFarm provides insurance based on the cc's of an engine and doesn't care about the type of bike. That's great for 1000cc+ Ducatistas because parts and repair for them are costly.
